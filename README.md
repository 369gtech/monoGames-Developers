<h1>monoGames-Developers</h1>
<p>Welome to all developers who have taken this opportunity to join monoGames. There are 3 catagories that you can join and they are Game Dev, Social Dev and Sustainable Dev which all play an important role in keeping monGames prosperous, thriving and sustaianable in the Metaverse interacting with The Real World. We have 12 Blockahins which include Signum, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, DOGE, Koinos, Hive, Wax, BSC, Pirate Chain, Dragon Chain and Zill that will be working together to build monoGames. Each Blockchain will have a token represented in the monoGames ecosystem. To earn in monoGames you will need to look at the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Tokenomics">Tokenomics</a> of monoGames which is very rewarding especially if you are a part of the monoGames Developer Team early on but as more Developers join so will the rewards be divided in those catagores diminishing the earning potential over 5 years of daily reward air drops.

There are a few rules to keep the monoGames sustainable. We have two types of investors, player investors (Stake 1,000,000 of all 12 tokens) and whale investors (Stake 10,000,000 of all 12 tokens) who have staked alot of tokens who beleive in monoGames. They have paid up front for a great experience and a great return which all their funds are being used to develop monoGames. So as we are the developers we need to keep these investors happy with freebies which will be explained when you connect your project to monoGames so please make allowances for our investors. Play2Free of Play2Earn monoGames is giving all players the option to Play4Free but you wont be able to earn any rewards. To earn rewards with Play2Earn you will need to pay $10 US. All funds raised go back into the monoGames ecosystem with 20% going directly into Research and Development.

This is how the share points rewards system works in short, a player accumulates share points by completing required tasks that earn that player share points for that particular airdrop pool. All share points are tallied by all players at the end of the 24 hour period and are then rewarded with a dividend of the Daily Drop. So if I complete tasks and earn a 1000 share points at the end of the 24 hour period and all other players had a total of 10,000 we tally the numbers 10,000 + my 1000 = 11,000 share points divided by the daily air drop of that paritcular pool. There is a total air drop of 21% (189,000,000,000) from the total monoGames Token (MTG 900,000,000,000) which is airdroped daily over 5 years (approx 103,561,643.8 daily) to all games evenly. This air drop is shared with every game that is added to monoGames, so as more games are added the pool is divided reducing the rewards per game. If you create your game early experct to earn some incredibly rewards early in the life of monoGames.

<h3>Game Developer</h3>
<p>Any one can develop games in monoGames even any of the 12 blockchains can build a game using their token but will need to add the monoGames Token (MTG) as part of their reward system. We hope developers come up with some really cool games for players to Play2Earn. As mentioned in the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Tokenomics">Tokenomics</a> of monoGames, there is a daily air drop of approximatley 9,863,013.6 that last 5 years to all Game Dev's who create and mainatain games for monoGames. Obviously the more Developers that create games the more you need to divide that reward pie so the early creators and maintiners will definatley earn consideratble rewards.

<h3>Summory</h3>
<p>
For any of the 12 Blockchains that can not add a token to their coin their will be a Token.Swap added for that coin. Also if their is no current market place to host nft's for any of the 12 Blockahins their nft's will be on the Signum NFT Market Place. monoGames will put a dedicated team together in association with any of the 12 Blockchains to help build either the token and/or the market place for those that dont have them currently. monoGames is more than building games we are about creating opportunities to give value for everyone in the ecosystem the way they want to earn. We are open to ideas and if you have any then please reach out to our <a href="https://discord.gg/5V4Y7y2gwV">discord</a> and let us know, we would love the feed back because monoGames is more than just games "were building a sustainable gaming ecosystem together with our ever evolving community".
